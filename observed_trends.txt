Within the data from Heroes of Pymoli, the following three trends were observed:

1. Although there is only a small percentage of women players, they have a higher average purchase total than men.

2. The most popular items were not the most popular because they were the cheapest. 

3. Majority of the players were adults, but kids, who only accounted for about 6% of the player, had the highest average purchase total per person.
